	I organise the conversion optimisation meet-up <a href="https://meetup.com/CRO-Melbourne/">CRO Melbourne</a>, have spoken at <a href="https://conversionconference.co.uk/">Conversion Conference London</a> and <a href="http://sydney.measurecamp.org/">Measure Camp Sydney</a> and had my work featured on the <a href="https://blog.optimizely.com/2016/07/13/how-does-page-load-time-impact-engagement/">Optimizely blog</a>.

<h2 class="mt-5">What I believe</h2>


<h3 class="mt-4">Simplicity is power</h2>
<p>
Easy to use, simple, clear and elegant design is important as both a process and an end result.
</p>
<p>
Stripping back a design to its most basic essentials lays our thinking and our process bare, remedies fuzziness and cloudy thinking.
</p>

<h3 class="mt-4">Evidence based design</h2>
	<p>
		Most designs are guesses, copies of their competitors, reflections of their own cultural biases... which is why users find them difficult and confusing, resulting in high bounce rates, low NPS scores and dwindling conversion.</p>
		<p>

Design patterns and interactions should be centred around observations (qualitative and quantitative) about how users interact and engage with them.
</p>
<h3 class="mt-4">Perfection = Variation + Feedback + Repetition</h2>
<p>
	We won’t get it right the first time.
</p>
<p>
Just as natural evolution allows creatures to adapt and change and prosper in their environment, if we continue listening to your customers and adapting and improving your website, we'll eventually achieve something (approaching) perfection.
