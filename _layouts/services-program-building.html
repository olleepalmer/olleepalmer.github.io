				<h1>How I can help</h1>
				<h2>Roadmap definition</h2>
				<p>At the start of my engagement, I will assess your internal capabilities, processes, strategy, and technology as Ill as working to understand your business goals and challenges.</p>
				<p>
					Drawing from my experience across a diverse range of industries, I then build out a comprehensive roadmap for your business.
				</p>
				<p>
					I focus on providing actionable initiatives to address immediate challenges, generating short-term wins while also providing a framework to drive long-term growth.
				</p>
				<h2 class="mt-5">Team training</h2>
				<p>
 Finding people with CRO expertise is tough.
				</p>
				<p>
						Instead of struggling to hire CRO people, I'll help you <em>make</em> CRO people.
						</p>
				<p>
					Through close collaboration and training, I'll help you turn your existing Product Managers, UX designers, User Researchers, Developers and BA's into a crack optimisation team.
				</p>

				<h2 class="mt-5">Building a culture of optimisation</h2>
				<p>
					A strong culture is the foundation on which any successful optimisation program is built.
				</p>
				<p>
					By working in close collaboration, our partnership will help to foster a data-driven testing culture within your business.
				</p>
				<p>
					I aim to promote a culture in which optimisation is a central practice in which the entire team participates and one which is aligned around the importance of measuring, assessing and improving performance.
				</p>
				<ul class="list">
					<li>
						<strong>Courageous</strong> – Being bold, unafraid of questioning the status quo, challenging conventional wisdom and 'best practise'
					</li>
					<li><strong>Inclusive</strong> – Great test concepts can come from anywhere (and often do)</li>
					<li><strong>Collaborative</strong> – Sharing knowledge, skills and ideas</li>
					<li><strong>Data-driven</strong> – Basing decisions on data over intuition</li>
					<li><strong>Fun</strong> – Setting up challenges around predicted results</li>
					<li><strong>Infectious</strong> – Great optimisation builds a virtuous cycle as results circulate throughout the business, building momentum and buy in</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Design, develop and implement tests</h2>
				<p>
					While you're building up your internal capability, you can rely on me to help you hit the ground running.
				</p>
				<p>
					With my flexible engagement model, in the beginning, I’ll be highly involved in each and every test.
				</p>
				<p>
					I can help with researching test concepts and hypothesis formation, design, UX, development, QA, the whole enchilada.
				</p>
				<p>
					Over time, I work to equip your team with the skills, processes and methodologies required so that they’re increasingly self-sufficient.
