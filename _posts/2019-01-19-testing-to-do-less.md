Tomato season is in full flight in Australia right now. 

I planted about eight heirloom varieties this year. I've got Tigerella tomatoes (they're are green with dark stripes), Tommy Toes, Jaune Flamme... Basically, I'm growing a lot of tomatoes.

When get home from work, I tend to grab a glass of wine and put on some music and go out into the garden and 

I spend time trimming lateral growths (this takes up a LOT of time), applying fertilisers of different kinds, I water them... basically, there's a lot to do when you're growing as many tomatoes as I am.

And while I'm doing this, the question that's often on my mind is... "What if I didn't do ANY of this?" "What would happen if I just let the plants run wild?"

I think about this a lot.

### The only way to really know for sure would be to run and I controlled experiment in my garden. 

I know, it sounds ludicrous... but actually a lot of what we do when running A/B tests is based on statistical methods that were applied first in agriculture. 

When the Green Revolution in the 1950s and 60s set about trying to meet challenge of scaling up agricultural yields to meet the challenges of population growth they relied very very heavily on experiments just like this to grow new high yielding varieties of rice and what.

When I am in my garden, I think about this a lot.

And I think a lot about the tests I run for my clients in the course on my work.

And just as I tend to my tomatoes in the hope that all the work I'm doing will increase the number of tomatoes on my plants, lots of the tests I'm doing with my clients are focused around initiates to increase the number of sales on their sites.

One of my clients is Kmart Australia. 


### People go absoluteley bananas for Kmart 

There are Facebook groups with hundreds of thousands of members (I'm not kidding) devoted to discussing Kmart products and sharing notes about how to get hard to find items.

They've had a meteoric rise over the last five years; transforming themselves fro a bargain basement discount retailer to an incredibly sophisticated design lead operation which has customers frothing at the mouth for more.

I've been working alongside their Trading, Customer Experience and Content teams over the last two years to build out a centralised experimentation program.

We test to mitigate risk (like when we tested a brand new homepage design this year and iterated a range of improvements to it), we test to improve on-site customer interactions and reduce inbound customer service calls.  We test all kinds of stuff.

Almost all of our tests are centred around an insight into customer behaviour: something that we have identified through research that customers find difficult or confusing or annoying.

## Optimising for conversion can be tough

What we've discovered, though, is that even when we know that these changes make the site better for customers, they rarely seem to raise conversion. 

One of the reasons for this, I think is that Kmart has a good case of what I increasingly hear referred to as 'Product/Market Fit'. Which is to say, they've got a great product which their customers love and are buying in droves. Since Kmart design and develop a lot of their own product, they're also the ONLY place where people can buy it from.

So they'll walk over glass to get it.

This makes optimisation a tricky proposition. 

We've ran a lot of tests which we know are focused around fixing usability issues and in many cases we could not see corresponding conversion lift.

## Doing less and achieving more

So, we decided to use a bit of a Jiu Jitsu move.

Kmart's merchandising team works frantically hard, merchandising all of products and engaging in all sorts of activities all based around the idea that they will help to increase sales.

So, we decided we would see if we would take the metaphorical step of letting our tomatoes grow wild.

What I mean by that is: we found some of the activities which team undertakes based on the otion that they will increase sales. 

And we thought we would see what would happen if we simply didn't do them at all.

We started out what Kmart call 'Tall Banners'. THey're banners that sit at the top of a category page and they have some beautiful photography which shows one or more of those products in situ and it styled it looks beautiful.

This is something that is really expensive to do. The team has to commission the photo and work with the catalogue team in the photo studio, and also because Kmart stock turns over fairly regularly they need to make sure that be photo on the category is always up to date and includes in stock products. This means that the category managers and the merchandising are continually having to monitor and rotate this imagery or request new imagery.

They have always done this, based on the idea that showing the products looking beautiful and in context makes customers want to buy more. Makes sense, right?

### What would happen if we just didn't do it?

We ran a test and, indeed, we found there was no impact.

The team estimated this saved them between 40 and 60 hours over the course of a month, which they can focus on activities which they know drive sales.

Encouraged by this result, we decided to try something more major.

Every time there is a campaign: it might be Mother's Day or Father's Day or Christmas or any of the other key events on the eCommerce calendar, Kmartwould work with their agency and commission a set of campaign beautiful campaign landing pages.

And they would look beautiful every single time. They would innovate more more with new layouts functionality and they made the product look absolutely stunning. 

So, we thought we'd see what happens if we didn't do that.

For the Father's Day campaign, we tested the beautiful campaign landing page against an ordinary out of the box category page generated by the e-commerce platform which features just a grid of productsa. And there was no difference. Aha!

Now, this technique isn't suitable for all sorts of stores. Many businesses selling luxury type products will find that they can use their on-site merchandising activity as a way to to present their products as luxurious and aspirational and use this was a way to help justify their prices.

But for Kmart this made perfect sense. 

They're a value based retailer that is focused on delivering the lowest prices and the best value to their customers. If their customers aren't receiving any additional benefit from something that cost the a considerable amount of money, then it makes absolutely no sense to continue.

What things has your team always done to increase sales, without ever testing it? Let your tomatoes grow wild and you might be surprised by what you find.
