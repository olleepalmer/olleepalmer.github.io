<p>Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft. The most innovative and profitable organisations of our time attribute experimentation as a vital competitive advantage. Business experimentation at scale is fast, convenient and accessible in a way that would have been incomprehensible only a few years ago.</p>





Despite this, so much business strategy continues to be dictated by persuasion, PowerPoint ‘best practise', prediction and outright guessing. For those few organisations that do establish their own testing infrastructure, many fail to unlock the transformative results they’d hoped for.

<h2>Why do so many businesses fail to build effective optimisation programs?</h2>

<h3>
Cultural change is not optional
</h3>
<p>
Making the transition from intuition and guessing toward iterative, data-driven experimentation takes a radical shift in both approach and mindset.
</p>
<p>
Senior managers are used to making expert proclamations from high, commanding both respect and remuneration for the depth of their experience and wisdom. Experimentation turns the status quo on its head. Running experiments will teach you very quickly that intuition and experience don’t count for much. This is a confronting and humbling process and requires brave initiates who are committed to achieving transformative outcomes at the expense of their egos.
</p>
<h3>
Staffing is a nightmare
</h3>
<p>
After signing off an exuberant business case for their new optimisation program, many organisations stumble when it comes to hiring. The best optimisers are in high demand and rarely available.
</p>
<p>
Optimisation draws on a broad skill set ranging from research, analysis, user experience design, psychology, analytics and statistics. There simply aren’t many people out there who can adequately tackle this range of disciplines. Those rare birds who can are typically employed as hired gun contractors, run their own consultancies or work at specialist agencies.
</p>
<p>
Many new optimisation programs end up being staffed by an inexperienced team with the right keywords in their LinkedIn profile but little experience at ushering in widespread cultural change. They’ll be learning on the job, wasting precious time and squandering the reputation of experimentation. The odds are stacked against them.

</p>

<h3>
Organisational structure
</h3>
<p>
Where should optimisation sit in the org chart? UX? Data? Product? Tech? Centre of excellence? Everyone does it differently and getting it wrong is the kiss of death for optimisation in your business. So many teams are assembled without the right training and experience, inadequately structured and then left to languish in obscurity or crumble under the heavy burden of executive expectations.</p>

<h3>
There is no playbook
</h3>
<p>
The history of business is hundreds of years of bold proclamations, guesses, gambles and predictions. Comparatively, we are in the early years of the age of experimentation. There is no defined playbook about how to do this. Everyone has to be a pioneer. Some make it to the frontier, some get shot by a volley of arrows.
