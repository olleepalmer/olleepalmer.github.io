The mandatory starting place for all new clients, this is a detailed piece of diagnostic detective work aimed at uncovering your biggest strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats.

Viewing your business with fresh eyes (and having undertaken scores of these reviews across different verticals over the years) I'm equipped to give you some critical perspective and what's working and, more importantly, what's not.

After undertaking a structured 1.5 hour long interview with you (and any other relevant stakeholders), I conduct a deep dive into your analytics data to build out a comprehensive, data driven picture of your business and identify both problems and opportunities for growth.

## Typical insights

**For a retailer** – Identified structural UX issues in the Checkout flow with significant conversion implications, discovered significant underperforming PPC segments.

**For a car manufacturer** — Uncovered that majority of PPC traffic was being sent to a faulty campaign page with a 99% bounce rate. Proposed a solution that saved $1.2m/month in wasted media spend, identified candidates for A/B testing which ultimately resulted in a 25% lift in test drive requests.

**For a superannuation fund** – Discovered that the method of reporting on their acquisition funnel was flawed, distorted and inaccurate with significant downstream impact across the business. Advised on implementing event- based tracking and filling other blindspots.

## Deliverables

Deliverables vary from engagement to engagement. I do not provide a rote checklist of data points, but rather I trawl through your analytics to identify and match patterns and surface the most useful and actionable insights.

Typically, however, we will expect to cover some of the below:

<ul class="list"><li><strong>Evaluation of traffic acquisition strategies</strong> both paid and organic to identify your most (and least) profitable traffic sources</li>

<li><strong>Competitive landscape review</strong> to see the good, brilliant, bad and ugly of what's happening in your vertical</li>

<li><strong>Review of conversion funnels</strong> to enumerate key drop-off points and help you understand where your digital properties are working (and where they need work)</li>

<li><strong>Macro level view of user behaviour</strong> to ascertain common tasks and user journey flows </li>

<li><strong>Analysis of key user segments</strong> to identify high and low performing cohorts for more granular targeting and analysis</li>

<li><strong>Auditing your analytics implementation</strong> to ensure that all relevant parts of the customer acquisition journey are being accurately and holistically measured</li>
</ul>

## Who should do this?

My typical client for this work is at an inflection point in their business and is actively seeking growth opportunities.

Beyond this, I'd suggest that you're a good candidate if more than one of the following apply to you:

<ul class="list">
<li><strong>You’re planning on redesigning or re-platforming</strong> or making other significant changes but you're not sure where to start</li>
<li><strong>You spend over $5k/month on traffic</strong></li>
<li><strong>You don’t trust your analytics data</strong></li>
</ul>

## How it works

**1.5 hour interview**
<br />We start the process with a structured interview (over a telephone call or Zoom or similar) during which I will ask a series of structured questions about your business. Covering off questions about your history, goals, teams and processes, this is to help give me a deep understanding of the context around your business, how you work and where you want to get to.

**Add me to your digital analytics platform(s)**<br />
I will provide an NDA to ensure the absolute secrecy and security of your business data.

**3-5 weeks later**<br />I will come back in three to four weeks with a detailed, microscopic view of your business past, present and future as seen through the lens of your analytics platform.
