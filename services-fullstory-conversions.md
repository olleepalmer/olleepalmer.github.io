## Here's how it works

### Discovery

Set the scene for a successful engagement by identifying KPIs, defining success and establishing program goals.

If you have an existing measurement plan, we'll align your FullStory tracking to these metrics.

If you don't, we'll pop open the hood and discuss your business, your goals and your customers. This will ensure that your FullStory implementation is set-up to allow the greatest clarity of insight.
