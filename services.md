Experimentation ðŸ“ˆ</h2>

<p>
I help my clients to make intelligent, data-informed decisions through experimentation with A/B and multivariate testing.
</p>
<p>
By carefully designing hypothesis-driven experiments we can trial alternative designs, messages, product features (and just about anything else you can think about it) on your real live site, with your real users, in real time.
</p>
<p>
I've used A/B testing to help:
</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>
Identify the right commercial threshold for offering free postage for a department store
</li>
<li>
Reduce in-bound customer support calls for a telco
</li>
<li>
Increase home loan appointments for a bank
</li>
<p>
...as well as plenty more, across a diverse range of industries. 
</p>

<h2 class="mt-5">User research ðŸ‘ª</h2>
<p>
If there's a better way to understand the strengths and weaknesses of a digital product than by spending 10 minutes showing it to real users, then I haven't yet found it.
</p>
<p>
I can help with:
</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Usability testing</li>
<li>Focus groups</li>
<li>Competitor evaluation & benchmarking</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="mt-5">Analytics ðŸ“Š </h2>
<p>
"If you canâ€™t measure it, you canâ€™t manage it", as the old saying goes.
</p>
<p>
I'll help you work out what you need to measure and how to transform data into actionable insights.
</p>
<p>
By aligning business goals with a framework of measurable outcomes, I'll help you understand your on-going business performance, uncover weaknesses, threats and opportunities.
</p>
<p>
I'm experienced with Google Analytics/GTM, Adobe Analytics and Segment as well as Heap, Mixpanel, Ampltiude and most of the others.
