<p>
The following is a brief overview of some of the overlapping techniques that I can use to help you get the best results out of your website, app and other digital properties:</p>

<h2 class="mt-5">
Experimentation ðŸ“ˆ</h2>

<p>
I help my clients to make intelligent, data-informed decisions through experimentation with A/B and multivariate testing.
</p>
<p>
By carefully designing hypothesis-driven experiments we can trial alternative designs, messages, product features (and just about anything else you can think about it) on your real live site, with your real users, in real time.
</p>
<p>
I've used A/B testing to help:
</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>
Identify the right commercial threshold for offering free postage for a department store
</li>
<li>
Reduce in-bound customer support calls for a telco
</li>
<li>
Increase home loan appointments for a bank
</li>
<p>
...as well as plenty more across a diverse range of industries. 
</p>

<h2 class="mt-5">User research ðŸ‘ª</h2>
<p>
If there's a better way to understand the strengths and weaknesses of a digital product than by spending 10 minutes showing it to real users, then I haven't yet found it.
</p>
<p>
I can help with:
</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Usability testing</li>
<li>Focus groups</li>
<li>Competitor evaluation & benchmarking</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="mt-5">Analytics ðŸ“Š </h2>
<p>
As the old saying goes, "If you canâ€™t measure it, you canâ€™t manage it."
</p>
<p>
I'll help you work out what you need to measure and how to apply the learnings from your data.
</p>
<p>
By aligning business goals with a framework of measurable outcomes, I'll help you understand your on-going business performance, uncover weaknesses, threats and opportunities.
</p>
<p>
I'm experienced with Google Analytics/GTM, Adobe Analytics, Segment as well as Heap, Mixpanel and Ampltiude.

Consulting & training ðŸ’¼ 
</h2>
<p>
I do lots of different work helping clients to get the best out of their website, their team and their tools.
</p>
<p>
Here's a selection of the things that I typically help with:
</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Vendor selection
<li>Building & scaling optimisation programs
<li>Measurement strategy
<li>Team training
</ul>
