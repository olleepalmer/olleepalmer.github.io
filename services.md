hero-header: "How many customers did you talk to when building your website?"
hero-subhead: "If the answer is 'zero' you're not alone."
hero-p:  "The big problem with so many websites is that they're written, designed and built without anyone actually bothering to talk to the people who going to use them.
<br /><br />
Rather than using genuine customer insight, they substitute ‘expert opinion’, generic ‘best practise’ and mindlessly copying the mistakes of their competitors.
<br /><br />
It's depressing.
<br /><br />
Instead, I'll help you to understand your customers and their needs better to boost your conversion rate, increase customer satisfaction and improve team efficiency.

<h3>Incremental transformation</h3>
<p>
The days of launching a brand new website from scratch and hoping for the best are dead as... disco (disco revival notwithstanding).
